# Variables

KQL supports 3 different types of variables, public variables, private variables, and constants. Further documentation on these can be found below.


### Public Variables
A public variable can be read, written, and removed by any connection at any time. These values are [ephemeral](/glossary#ephemeral) meaning they disappear when the database closes for any reason
