# F.A.Q.
Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about KQL, in no particular order.

#### Q: Why not just use SQL?
> **A:** KQL was created specifically to be tailored for an asynchronous environment. It's purpose is to provide powerful queries, with minimal content, whilst ensuring that all content is processed quickly, securely, and efficiently.

#### Q: what are the benefits of KQL over SQL?
> **A:** SQL (at least at it's core) does not provide any way for defining variables. One of the things that KQL provides is the ability to define variables of multiple different types, for more info see the [variables section](syntax/variables)
